![Main Interface](static/interface.png)

## Project Overview
AgriBot is an AI-powered Python web application designed to assist farmers by providing quick and accurate agricultural information. Using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, AgriBot intelligently fetches relevant data from a wide range of agricultural websites and PDF resources. It then processes and delivers detailed, personalized responses to user queries, enabling farmers to access expert advice and guidance.

## Features

- Fetches content from specified agricultural websites.
- Extracts text from PDF documents.
- Initializes a vector store for efficient information retrieval.
- Uses a Retrieval QA chain with a language model to answer agriculture-related queries.
- Provides an intuitive web interface for easy interaction.

## Additional Notes

- The language model used is meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf.
- The application uses the Together API for LLM services.
- Add your own Together API key in the chat2.py file.
  
```
llm = Together(
	model="meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf",
	max_tokens=512,
	temperature=0.1,
	top_k=1,
	together_api_key="YOUR_Together_API_KEY"
)
```

- The requirements.txt should include all necessary packages such as Flask, requests, PyPDF2, langchain, chroma, and any other dependencies required by your project.
